GOALS OF SDL_GuiTK
------------------

 * 	Providing a "light" but extended GUI for the great SDL library.
	To be fully implemented on SDL, using SDL_ttf for text layout.
	http://www.libsdl.org
 *	Providing a powerfull and lisible interface:
	dynamics of widgets and name-spacing copied from Gtk.
	(so for docs, see gtk-doc and substitutes gtk_ by SDLGuiTK_)
	http://www.gtk.org
 *	Providing two drawing contexts:
	- SELF_MODE, "a la Gtk" ou "a la paragui"
	- SLAVE_MODE, initialized on a external surface (integration)

 *	Structures and relevant attributes must be OK:
	infrastructures: Cursor, Timer, Theme, threated Context.
	widgets:         Bitmap, DockedWin, Entry.

DEVEL STATUS

	containers:      Container, Misc, Bin.
	widgets:         Window, Alignment, Box, Label, Button.

OPENGL INTEGRATION
------------------


Note: SDL2 portage only support GL context for now.

GL context must be determinated in run-time.
If no GL found, SDLGuiTK uses 2D-Blit functions on the main surface.
For this purpose, concerned functions are layed by a (*function)().
They are setted in mysdl.c, when GL detection is done.
They are:
	MySDL_MainSurface_clean()		_GL() / _noGL()
	MySDL_SwapBuffers()			_GL() / _noGL()
	MyWM_blit2Dsurface()			_GL() / _noGL()


THREADED USE
------------

Like in GTK, a unique mutex protect internal structures.
Locked an unlocked by:
	SDLGuiTK_threads_enter()
	SDLGuiTK_threads_leave()
